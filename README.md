# Histoplasma Phylogenetic Tree pipeline
## How to run the phylogenetic tree generated for this publication.

1. Build the proper environment to run the analysis. You might need separate environments if all are not compatable with each other.
   The main program used here is:
   * phyling - https://github.com/stajichlab/PHYling this program has undergone a lot of new changes in the past year (stay tuned for the pub!)
   * IQtree 2 version 2.2.2.7 or higher (this is the main program we used to generate our tree)
   * phykit - https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/PhyKIT awesome tool for overall tree manipulation
   * modeltest-ng - https://github.com/ddarriba/modeltest this will be helpful with partition testing
